bradata
#######

bradata means to make easily available **all** Brazilian government data
as a Python package.

it should be as symple as:

.. code-block:: python

    import bradata

    bradata.inep.enem.get()

and you should have all ENEM microdata in your ``/bradata\_download`` 
directory.\*

documentation is available at
`http://bradata.readthedocs.io/ <http://bradata.readthedocs.io/>`_.

\* except the ENEM module is not ready. we have a lot of work to do, and we 
would love to have contributors!

status
======

this package is in the early stages of development. the only modules we have so 
far are those that download data from:

- Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE)

- Controladoria-Geral da Uni√£o (CGU)

- Infraero

of which none are complete so far.
